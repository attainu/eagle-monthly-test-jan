1) Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.


- Example:

  Input: [0,1,0,3,12]

  Output: [1,3,12,0,0]



- Edge cases:

  Input: [0,1,0,12,3]

  Output: [1,12,3,0,0]


- Input: []

  Output: []


- note:
  You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
  Minimize the total number of operations.
  mention time and space complexity of your algorithm.
  Handle the edge cases.
